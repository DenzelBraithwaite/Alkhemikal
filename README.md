# Alkhemikal - Potion making game with minigames
What is Alkhemikal: I started this project as a way to practice Ruby OOP while studying web development. It was supposed to be to practice CRUD operations, especially on hashes, but it grew to be so much more than that.
Alkhemikal is now one big CLI game (the game is played in a terminal, typing commands to progress) that's comprised of multiple smaller minigames that all tie together with gold, ingredients and items.
The game can take around 4 hours to complete, and probably a few more hours to 100% it, with no option to save (at this moment).

Main menu:

The main menu has 6 options, not including the tutorial and the quit game option.
1. Explore - a simple loop where you can continuously press enter to find ingredients, these ingredients are used for potions, but not all ingredients are useful.
2. Potions - The core of the game and the only way to beat the game. The goal is to create the final potion, which requires many ingredients.
3. Billywig - A blackjack spinoff with some special rules. You gamble gold here and try to get as close to 26 as possible.
4. Labyrinth - A popular choice by most including myself. You're dropped in a random position in a 400 room labyrinth with multiple regions. You can find gold and items here, but can also die and lose all your gold.
5. Inventory - Here is where you can change your equipment and even your name. Certain names have special effects, considered as cheat codes.
6. Shop - The final addition to the game. Here you can buy equipment, ingredients and even advice. But beware, the shopkeeper has been known to sell a few 'lemons'.
7. Tutorial - A quick overview of the entire game and how to progress and eventually, win.

Here's a few pictures to give you a better idea of how the game looks, and is played.

The game requires a CLI or terminal that can run Ruby files, you can do a quick google search to find out how to set one up and configure it.
I'm not actively working on the project anymore, but in the future, there are a few small things I'd like to change, such as adding save files to the game for instance.
Thanks for taking the time to stop by and read this, stay awesome :)
